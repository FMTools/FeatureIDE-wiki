<!-- Introduction -->
Working on a project with a lot of contributer requires a strict an well structured way to handle issues and new features. In the following we are going to describe the issue workflow for FeatureIDE.


1.  Search for a similar issue and maybe comment this one.
2.  If no issue was found you can create a new one based on the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/tthuem/FeatureIDE/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) we provide.
3. The FeatureIDE team will discuss the new feature or issue

  3.1. After the discussion the feature or issue is either accepted or rejected

4. Solve the issue
5. After solving the issue or feature revise the ticket to at least one(more are prefered) other active developer.
6. If no complains one can close the ticket.
