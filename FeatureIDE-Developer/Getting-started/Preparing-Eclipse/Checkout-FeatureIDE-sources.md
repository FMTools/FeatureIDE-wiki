1. Checkout the FeatureIDE repository
   * If you aim to change FeatureIDE code create a fork in advance
   * Use link [https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE) or link of your own fork
2. Configure Working Sets as top level elements in Package Explorer (for better overview on plug-ins and tests)
3. Create Working Sets for plug-ins and tests
4. Import the plug-ins from the subfolder "plugins"
   * Right click on the Working Set in Package Explorer
   * Do not search for nested projects to not import
   * We recommend to import all plug-ins
5. Import the tests from the subfolder "tests" (analog to previous step)
