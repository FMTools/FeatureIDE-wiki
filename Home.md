**Welcome to the FeatureIDE wiki!**

<p align="justify">
FeatureIDE is an Eclipse-based IDE that supports all phases of feature-oriented software development for the development of Software product lines: domain analysis, domain implementation, requirements analysis, and software generation. Different SPL implementation techniques are integrated such as feature-oriented programming (FOP), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), delta-oriented programming (DOP), and preprocessors.
