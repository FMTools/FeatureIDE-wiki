Software product lines (SPL) have a long tradition and will gain momentum in the future. Today's research tries to move software development to a new quality of industrial production. Several solutions concerning different phases of the software development process have been proposed in order to cope with different problems of program family development. A major problem of program family engineering is still the missing tool support. The vision is an IDE that brings all phases of the development process together, consistently and in a user-friendly manner.

FeatureIDE is an Eclipse-based IDE that supports all phases of feature-oriented software development for the development of SPLs: domain analysis, domain implementation, requirements analysis, and software generation. Different SPL implementation techniques are integrated such as feature-oriented programming (FOP), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), delta-oriented programming (DOP), and preprocessors.
