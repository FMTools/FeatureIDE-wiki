# Collaboration View
The Collaboration View shows a table of all classes and features. Features are displayed in columns and the attached classes are displayed in rows. It filters for fields, methods, refinements, contracts, invariants, nested classes and access-modifiers. A field in the table shows fields, methods and nested classes ordered by classes. New roles can be created and deleted within the collaboration diagram. If u hover over a role it shows a tooltip with informations about the number of fields , methods and nested classes per role. In the top right u have buttons to filter equal to the context menu. 

The function of the toolbar from left to right are:
