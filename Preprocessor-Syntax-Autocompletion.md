The Preprocessor Syntax Autocompletion is integrated in the Eclipse Autocompletion Adapter and provides appropriate suggestions for each of the three current preprocessors . Furthermore, the Autocompletion Computer will support the user in learning the specific syntax of the preprocessor by deciding according to the current input if it suggests keywords, features or nothing.

The supported preprocessors are **Antenna**, **CPP** and **Munge**. 

## Supported keywords:
### Antenna: 
if, endif, ifdef, ifnder, elif, elifdef, elifndef, else, condition, define, undefine
### Antenna: 
if, if_not, else, end
### Colligens CPP: 
ifdef, ifndef, else, endif, define, undefine, if
