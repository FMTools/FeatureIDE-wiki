<!-- Introduction -->
Your primary tool to interact with the feature model is the context menu. It offers different actions depending on which elements you have selected.

<!-- Content -->

1. **Presentation Menu** 
 
    This menu contains actions that change the way the diagram is presented. It pops up when you press the right mouse button while you don't have anything selected or if your selection contains an illegal combination of features, constraints and connections.

2. **Feature Edit Menu**

    This menu gives you access to actions that directly change the individual features or the structure of the feature model. It appears if you press the right mouse button while you have one or more features selected. Some actions are only available if you have selected exactly one feature, they will be greyed out if you select more than that.

3. **Connection Menu**

    This menu appears if you select a connection. It lets you change the relation of parent features with its children. As of right now you can't select more than one connection.
