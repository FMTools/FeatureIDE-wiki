<!-- Introduction -->
The **FeatureIDE Outline** shows all fields and methods in the current file. It is also capable of displaying nested classes. 
The behaviour and design is similar to the Eclipse Default Outline. In addition it supports Haskell, CSharp, Java and C files.
All gray colored entries are not present in the current feature, while all black entries occur in it.
On the upper right there is a toolbar with buttons to filter/sort fields and methods as seen in the picture below.
