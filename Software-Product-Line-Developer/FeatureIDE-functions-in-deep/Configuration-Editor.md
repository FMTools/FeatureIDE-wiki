The configuration editor helps to customize you program. The editor is always in sync with the feature model of the FeatureIDE project. For example, if you rename a feature in the model, also the feature in configuration file is renamed, too. 
Furthermore, the configuration editor checks whether the configuration is valid to the feature model.

_You can open a configuration with the configuration editor with a double-click on a configuration file. _

The default page shows the configuration as tree similar to the structure defined in the feature model.
