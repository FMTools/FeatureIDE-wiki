The configuration editor helps to customize you program. The editor is always in sync with the feature model of the FeatureIDE project. For example, if you rename a feature in the model, also the feature in configuration file is renamed, too. 
Furthermore, the configuration editor checks whether the configuration is valid to the feature model.

_You can open a configuration with the configuration editor with a double-click on a configuration file. _

The **default page** shows the configuration as tree similar to the structure defined in the feature model.
Selected features are either marked with an check mark or with a box. The indicated that the selection of the feature is implied by other feature selections; such features cannot be deselected manually until the other feature is deselected. The check mark indicates that the feature is selected manually, thus the features can also be deselected manually. A gray coloring indicates that the feature cannot be selected anymore because of the selection of other features.
