<!-- Introduction -->
As FeatureIDE projects are on top of existing projects (e.g., Java projects) and the compiler of this project automatically generates the binary files, you can execute the generated product as if you are working with a standard project.

For Java Projects: _Right click on the project > Run As > Java Application_
