The Feature Order View is a TODO
Remember that using the Feature Order View is only possible by using a FeatureIDE Project that is not for modelling purposes only.
In short, creating, for example, an Antenna, FeatureHouse or Munge Project will enable the Feature Order View.

## Using the Feature Order View
To use the Feature Order View select the tab "Feature Order" at the bottom of the Feature Model View.

<p align="center">
<img alt="Feature Order Select1" src="https://github.com/Henningson/FeatureIDETeam2/wiki/Assets/FeatureModelEditor/FeatureOrder/FeatureOrderSelect1.png">
</p>

Then just select the checkbox "User-defined feature order".

## Updating the position of Features
To update the position of Features using the Feature Order View, just select the Features you want to move. Then you can choose between the following two possibilites to order the Features.

### Buttons

#### Up
The Up-Button moves the selected Features one column up.


#### Down
The Down-Button moves the selected Features one column down.


#### Default
The Default-Button sorts the Features by using a pre-order traversal method.
You can find more about pre-order traversal [here].


### Drag and Drop
You can also position features by using Drag and Drop.
Select the features you want to position, hold left-click and position your mouse at the column at which you want to insert them.
